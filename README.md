## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The intention of this project is to examine my personal Fitbit data and look for larger utlization trends that the app typically can not provide. I know how I think I use my Fitbut but what does the data truly show:

1. Am I consistent in wearing my Fitbit? 
2. Does the weekday/weekend utilization differ? How?
3. 

The data used was downloaded from Fitbit using the steps [here](https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1133.htm). I used only my 2021 Activity data for this analysis.
